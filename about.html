    Something new is brought into existence when people notice a few missing links in what already exists. In an industry that had the biggest name as old as some of us with Scorehub we wanted to connect the young cricket fans to the game. Despite the highs and lows on the cricket field it was expected that maturity of other sports and audience acceptance will witness a dip in the following for cricket. Being cricket crazy fans we wanted to defy that. <br><br>

    We made it our mission to bring back the focus on cricket and to date we strive to do that.
